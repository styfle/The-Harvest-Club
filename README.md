# The Harvest Club

This is a system designed for The Harvest Club by a group of students in IN4MATX 117 at UC, Irvine.
We have permission to open source our code, but we do not offer support so use at your own risk.


## Config
You will need to create a file called `include/config.inc.php` and define some constants in there. Here is an example:

```php
<?php
define('PAGE_TITLE', 'The Harvest Club - CPanel');

define('MYSQL_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('MYSQL_USER', 'nyan');
define('MYSQL_PASS', 'd4x9S0Pyo');
define('MYSQL_DB', 'harvest');

define('MAIL_FROM', 'admin@example.com');
define('MAIL_TO', 'admin@example.com');
define('MAIL_REPLYTO', 'noreply@example.com');

define('SESSION_MAX_LENGTH', 60); // logout after inactive for x seconds
?>
```
